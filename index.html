        <h2>History of Mountaineering</h2>
        <div class="flex-container2">
            <img src="his.jpg" alt="Mountain">
        </div>
        <p>The history of mountaineering dates back to ancient times when 
            mountains were seen as both a challenge and a place of worship or
            isolation. In the 18th century, mountaineering took on a more recreational
             aspect with the first ascent of Mont Blanc in 1786, marking the
             beginning of modern mountaineering. The 19th century saw a golden age
             with many peaks in the Alps being climbed, alongside the development 
            of new techniques and equipment. In the 20th century, mountaineering
            reached its peak with the first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 
            1953. Since then, the sport has diversified into mountain climbing
             , rock climbing, and ice climbing, with a greater focus on safety
              and environmental conservation.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Techniques</h2>
        <p>1. Rock Climbing
            Bouldering: Climbing short, yet challenging rock formations without ropes or harnesses, typically with a focus on technique and strength.
            Sport Climbing: Climbing on pre-equipped routes with bolts for protection. Climbers clip their rope into these bolts as they ascend.
            Traditional (Trad) Climbing: Climbers place their own protective gear (like cams and nuts) into cracks and crevices as they ascend, rather than relying on pre-placed bolts.
            2. Ice Climbing
            Single and Multi-pitch Ice Climbing: Using specialized tools like ice axes and crampons to climb frozen waterfalls or ice-covered rock faces. This requires careful planning, technique, and protection placement.
            Mixed Climbing: Combining both ice and rock climbing on routes where the surface is alternating between ice and rock.
            3. Alpine Climbing
            Snow and Ice Traversing: Climbing in snowy conditions, often using techniques like front-pointing (using crampons with the front points facing downward) and using ice axes for balance and support.
            Rope Team Techniques: When climbing in groups, climbers may be roped together to prevent falls and manage crevasses. Climbing in a rope team involves techniques like belaying (controlling the rope) and rappelling.
            Crevasse Rescue: In glacier areas, climbers must know how to rescue fallen climbers from crevasses (deep cracks in glaciers) using systems of ropes, anchors, and mechanical devices.</p>

        <h2>Sheltering</h2>
        <p>Base Camps
            Location: At the foot or lower reaches of the mountain, often at an accessible altitude.
            Purpose: Base camps serve as the starting point for climbs and a place to acclimatize, rest, and resupply. These camps can provide tents, food, and equipment for climbers before they ascend higher altitudes.
            Example: Everest Base Camp is one of the most famous examples, where climbers gather before making their ascent to higher camps.
            2. Advanced/High-altitude Camps
            Location: Set up at various stages on the mountain, typically at higher altitudes, where climbers stop to rest or acclimatize before the summit push.
            Purpose: These camps help climbers acclimate to thinner air and provide a safe place to rest after a long day of climbing. Shelters in high-altitude camps are usually tents that are designed to withstand severe weather conditions like snow, wind, and extreme cold.
            Example: Camp I, Camp II, and so on for Everest expeditions or similar high-altitude climbs.
            3. Natural Shelters
            Location: Found throughout the mountain terrain, often in more remote or challenging locations.
            Types of Natural Shelters:
            Caves: Natural rock formations, often located in valleys or cliffs, where climbers can find refuge from storms.
            Rock Overhangs: Large rock formations that provide overhead shelter from rain or snow, offering a temporary refuge.</p>
